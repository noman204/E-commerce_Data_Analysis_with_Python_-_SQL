# E-commerce Data Analysis with Python & SQL

# Project Summary:

This project focuses on analyzing an e-commerce database using SQL queries within a Python environment. By extracting and analyzing key data points, the project provides insights into customer behavior, sales trends, and business performance. It serves as a foundational guide for data analysts, business intelligence professionals, and developers looking to work with SQL-based databases in e-commerce analytics.This project presents a comprehensive analysis of key performance indicators in an e-commerce platform over the years 2016 to 2018. The analysis includes several visualizations that summarize payment trends, revenue generation, customer engagement, and geographic distribution of customers.

# 🔍 Key Objectives

The primary goals of this project include:

1.Customer Insights – Identifying unique customer locations, frequent buyers, and purchase behavior.

2.Order Analysis – Examining order trends, peak sales periods, and annual performance.

3.Product Performance – Understanding total sales per product category, high-revenue items, and underperforming products.

4.Business Growth Metrics – Analyzing revenue trends, repeat customer rates, and sales distribution across regions.


# 🛠 Technologies & Tools Used

1.Python – Used for database connectivity, data retrieval, and visualization.

2.SQL – Utilized for querying structured data and generating reports.

3.SQLite/MySQL/PostgreSQL – Example databases that can be used for running queries.

4.Jupyter Notebook – Interactive platform for running Python and SQL together.

5.Pandas & Matplotlib – For data manipulation and visualization (if applicable).


# 📊 Implementation Details

# 1️⃣ Database & Dataset Structure
The project assumes an e-commerce relational database containing multiple tables, such as:

*Customers (Customer ID, Name, City, Country, Email, etc.)

*Orders (Order ID, Customer ID, Order Date, Order Amount, Status, etc.)

*Products (Product ID, Category, Price, Stock Availability, etc.)

*Order Details (Order ID, Product ID, Quantity, Total Price, etc.)

*Each SQL query interacts with these tables to fetch meaningful insights.


# 2️⃣ Key SQL Queries & Analysis

The project includes a series of structured SQL queries to answer business-related questions, such as:

🔹 List all unique cities where customers are located

🔹 Find the number of orders placed in a specific year (e.g., 2017)

🔹 Calculate total sales per product category

🔹 Determine the most purchased product

🔹 Identify customers with the highest lifetime value (LTV)

🔹 Analyze the monthly revenue growth

Each query is written efficiently using SQL SELECT, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, JOIN, and aggregate functions (SUM, COUNT, AVG).



# 3️⃣ Python & SQL Integration

Python is used alongside SQL to:

✔ Connect to the database (using SQLite3, MySQL Connector, or SQLAlchemy)

✔ Execute SQL queries within Python scripts

✔ Retrieve and manipulate query results using Pandas

✔ Visualize trends using Matplotlib/Seaborn

# 📌 Potential Use Cases

This project can be useful for:

✅ Business Analysts & Data Scientists – Extract and interpret e-commerce trends for decision-making.

✅ Developers & Engineers – Learn database interaction with Python and SQL.

✅ E-commerce Store Owners – Gain insights into their business using data-driven approaches.

✅ Students & Beginners – Practice SQL queries in a real-world scenario.
