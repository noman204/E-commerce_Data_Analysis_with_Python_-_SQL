# 🔍 Key Objectives

The primary goals of this project include:

1.Customer Insights – Identifying unique customer locations, frequent buyers, and purchase behavior.

2.Order Analysis – Examining order trends, peak sales periods, and annual performance.

3.Product Performance – Understanding total sales per product category, high-revenue items, and underperforming products.

4.Business Growth Metrics – Analyzing revenue trends, repeat customer rates, and sales distribution across regions.


# 🛠 Technologies & Tools Used

1.Python – Used for database connectivity, data retrieval, and visualization.

2.SQL – Utilized for querying structured data and generating reports.

3.SQLite/MySQL/PostgreSQL – Example databases that can be used for running queries.

4.Jupyter Notebook – Interactive platform for running Python and SQL together.

5.Pandas & Matplotlib – For data manipulation and visualization (if applicable).


# 📊 Implementation Details

# 1️⃣ Database & Dataset Structure
The project assumes an e-commerce relational database containing multiple tables, such as:

*Customers (Customer ID, Name, City, Country, Email, etc.)

*Orders (Order ID, Customer ID, Order Date, Order Amount, Status, etc.)

*Products (Product ID, Category, Price, Stock Availability, etc.)

*Order Details (Order ID, Product ID, Quantity, Total Price, etc.)

*Each SQL query interacts with these tables to fetch meaningful insights.


# 2️⃣ Key SQL Queries & Analysis

The project includes a series of structured SQL queries to answer business-related questions, such as:

🔹 List all unique cities where customers are located

🔹 Find the number of orders placed in a specific year (e.g., 2017)

🔹 Calculate total sales per product category

🔹 Determine the most purchased product

🔹 Identify customers with the highest lifetime value (LTV)

🔹 Analyze the monthly revenue growth

Each query is written efficiently using SQL SELECT, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, JOIN, and aggregate functions (SUM, COUNT, AVG).



# 3️⃣ Python & SQL Integration

Python is used alongside SQL to:

✔ Connect to the database (using SQLite3, MySQL Connector, or SQLAlchemy)

✔ Execute SQL queries within Python scripts

✔ Retrieve and manipulate query results using Pandas

✔ Visualize trends using Matplotlib/Seaborn

# 📊 Key Insights & Analysis

The project presents several critical insights through data exploration and visualization:

1️⃣ Payments Distribution (2016-2018) 📈
Examines the total payments made across various categories over three years.
A notable peak in 2017 suggests increased transaction volume, possibly due to promotional campaigns or seasonal trends.
Helps businesses understand customer spending habits and optimize pricing strategies.

2️⃣ Revenue Overview by Product Category 💰
Analyzes revenue contributions across different product categories to identify top-performing items.
A specific product category dominates sales, suggesting high customer demand and brand loyalty.
Insights from this analysis can guide businesses in stocking high-demand products and adjusting inventory levels.

3️⃣ Customer Orders by City 🏙
Identifies cities with the highest average products per order, showcasing differences in customer behavior across locations.
This insight is valuable for targeted marketing strategies and regional sales optimizations.

4️⃣ Monthly Order Count for 2018 📅
Analyzes order trends across each month in 2018 to detect seasonal patterns.
Sales remained consistent throughout the year, except for a decline in September and October.
Businesses can use this insight to plan promotional campaigns and boost off-season sales.

5️⃣ Customer Distribution by State 🌍
Displays customer count by state, with São Paulo (SP) leading as the dominant market.
Shows regional demand patterns, helping businesses optimize logistics and customer outreach.
